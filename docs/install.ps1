# Resolve version + Windows asset URL with a two-tier lookup:
#   1) GitHub Releases API — full release record (matches old behavior).
#   2) echobird.ai/api/version/index.json — our own version manifest, no
#      rate limit, no anonymous quota. Used as a fallback because
#      api.github.com's 60-req/hour anonymous bucket gets exhausted fast
#      when a user retries within a minute of release publication, and
#      Github also occasionally serves region-specific 403s. The manifest
#      is updated by sync-version-manifest.yml on the same `release:
#      published` event that makes the binaries downloadable, so a
#      manifest-reported version is always already-downloadable.
